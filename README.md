# Predicting-Loan-Defaults-Using-Financial-Data
## Objective:
To develop a predictive model that identifies clients who are at risk of defaulting on their loans by leveraging macroeconomic indicators from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), utilizing Hadoop for data processing and feature engineering
## Description:
This project aims to predict the likelihood of loan default for clients by incorporating macroeconomic data into the analysis. By using economic indicators such as unemployment rates, interest rates, and GDP growth, combined with client-specific financial data, the project will provide a comprehensive model for assessing loan risk. Hadoop will be used for processing and managing large datasets efficiently.
## Key Components
### Data Gathering and Preprocessing:
#### Collect economic data from FRED:
Identify and download relevant datasets (e.g., unemployment rate, federal funds rate, GDP per capita, consumer price index, and consumer sentiment index).
Data sources: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
#### Preprocess the data to ensure consistency and usability:
Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Normalize and standardize data as needed.
### Feature Engineering:
#### Create features from the macroeconomic data:
Generate lagged features to capture temporal effects.
Create rolling averages and other statistical summaries.
#### Integrate these features with client-specific financial data:
Merge macroeconomic features with client-level data such as credit scores, income, loan amount, and repayment history.
Use Hadoop for large-scale data processing and integration.
### Model Development:
#### Develop and train machine learning models using the combined dataset:
Split data into training, validation, and testing sets.
Train various machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, neural networks).
#### Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics:
Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
### Model Optimization:
#### Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance:
Use grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization.
Apply cross-validation to ensure robust tuning.
### Model Testing and Validation:
#### Test the final model on a validation set to ensure generalizability:
Evaluate the model on an unseen validation set to check for overfitting.
Adjust the model based on validation performance.
### Visualization and Reporting:
#### Create visualizations to present the prediction results and key metrics:
Use visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, or PowerBI to create informative charts and graphs.
Visualizations might include feature importance, ROC curves, confusion matrices, and time series plots.
